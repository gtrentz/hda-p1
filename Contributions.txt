Week of 2/12 - 2/18

Overall Task:
Find and begin to look at the data. Start to consider how might we want to analyze it. Do some basic stats and visuals to accomplish this.

Trevor:
Added a few visuals new visualizations of bar graphs and pie charts to help understand the categorical variables in the dataset. Added a new attribute to the csv to help visualize data easier.

Grant: Pull down datasets from clinicaltrials.gov, read them into python file to create graphs and make inferences about the data; break 
different visualizations into functions for better organization

Gabe:
Look at some summary stats in jupyter using pandas. Look at some distributions to understand study size, phasing and even more basic stuff like what columns do we have, what kind of schemas are they using, etc. 


Week of 2/19-2/25

Overall Task:
Segment areas of analysis for individual contribution. (3 columns each to focus on). Began exploratory visual analysis to understand trends which warrant further examination.

Intervention, Adverse Events, Design Aspect
Cleaned the Intervention data to help visualize drug types frequencies and intervention types. Basic visualizations to understand the Interventions data.

Grant:
Phase, Status, Duration
Made some graphs to look for correlation between datapoints and draw analysis; discussed how to organize our findings with the team.
